# X-Team 116 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
1. Consider everyone's specialties and strengths. Assign tasks to best align with these specialties and strengths so that we are as efficient as possible. That said, we should all try to be familiar with each of the tasks.
2. Try to assign tasks so that work is about equal, though if everyone agrees, assigned work could be uneven in the short term (but even over the long term) to best fit in with everyone's schedule.
3. Try to mutually agree on task assignments so that we don't have to resort to randomly assigning. Volunteering is good.
4. Recognize that it is often difficult to know how long a task will take or how hard it is, so we will need to be somewhat flexible and dynamic with tasks even after they've been assigned.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
1. Create a status document for the project that lists tasks, who is assigned to those tasks, and the expected timeline for completion.
2. Keep track of your own progress and mark that on the document, but also look at everyone else's progress to see if a reminder or extra help might be necessary.


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
1. Tell everyone in the team that you are having a problem with the task and what it is about.
2. The team will then come up with a solution as to how to fix the problem. If it is a knowledge/coding issue, perhaps a team member might know how to fix it. If not, we could use outside resources (TA/internet/etc.). If the issue is related to workload, we will discuss potential reallocation.



## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
1. Keep track of everyone's status.
2. Communicate frequently, even if it's just a quick check-in. The more we are talking/thinking about assignments and CS in general, the harder it is to forget about something.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
1. Always share idea and knowledge so the team can generate the best results
2. Use collaborating application to better our productivity such as Slack and Trello
3. Keep open communication on progress made on each others assignments
